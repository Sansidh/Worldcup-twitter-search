# TED-Recommender
[http://Ted-recommender.com](http://3.17.150.50)
Web Application built for reseach purpose. 
The mission is to apply basic concept on Data Mining and Machine Learning to develop a simple search, classification, and recommendation system. 



The whole web application consists of 3 features *search, classification, and recommendation* on a dataset of Ted-Talks videos from beginning to September 2017. 
All there features are developed inside **ted_engine.py** file, which is initialized and used by **ted.py** file. This file is a *flask* application, that connects the logic from back-end to the front-end. All files inside folder static and templates are for the *front-end HTML and CSS*  file.

To replication and got the application up running in localhost, there are just some simple steps next to be done.
After retrieving the project to a local machine 

**Step 1:**  Prepare the run environment:

Because the application is written using python 3.7.0 with few necessary libraries. Make sure local machine have already installed python 3, flask, numpy, pandas, and nltk libraries. If not you can easily install python 3 and pip tool to install the needed libraries (https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

**Step 2:** Execute the application:

Simply run the command inside your terminal: python ted.py 
Your application should be up running at http://localhost:5000 
You can use your browser to go to this address and start using the application. There is a search field for finding your favorite Ted-talks. There is also a recommend button under each result's videos. Finally, the classification feature helps you to classify any Ted-talks contents that you can think of.
